            Keyboard Sounds Editor is a tool for creating and editing keyboard
            sound profiles. It allows you to easily add and manage audio
            sources, as well as apply them to different keys on the keyboard.

        <Paper sx={{ p: 2, mb: 2 }}>

            Manage Sources
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            To get started, click the "Manage Sources" button in the top right
            corner of the editor. This will open a dialog where you can add,
            edit, and manage audio sources.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
            Add the audio sources you intend to assign by clicking the "Add
            Source" button and providing the audio files you want to use.
          </Typography>

        <Paper sx={{ p: 2 }}>

            Assign to Keys
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            Once you have added sources, you can apply them to different keys on
            the keyboard.
            <ol>
              <li>Select the keys you want to apply the sources to</li>
              <li>Select the audio source you want to apply to them.</li>
              <li>Click the "Apply" button</li>
            </ol>
            <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mt: 1, mb: 1 }}>
              This will apply the selected sources to the selected keys.
